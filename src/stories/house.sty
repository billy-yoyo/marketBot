	You wake up in a hallway, you can see doors to a living room, dining room, kitchen and small bathroom. In the hallway is a staircase going to the next floor.
	All of the windows you can see are boarded up and the front door is completely jammed shut.

		{
			The boards are nailed firmly to the wall, You'd need something pretty hefty to break through them.
			There are a few shafts of light coming through the gaps in the boards.

		{
			There are a couple of logs in the fireplace with some ash below them. The fireplace has clearly been lit recently.
			The logs feel slightly odd to touch, as if they're not quite made of wood.
			\
			Below one of the logs is a burnt sheet of paper, you can just about make out some of the letters:
			\
			\	 Fe  x,
